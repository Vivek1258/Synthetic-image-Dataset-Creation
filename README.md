The Size of a Data Set :

As a rough rule of thumb, your model should train on at least an order of magnitude more examples than trainable parameters. Simple models on large data sets generally beat fancy models on small data sets.

hence the size of a dataset matters. 
while maintaning the quality the size of the data set can be increased 
this can be done by changing the data pixel values as well as rotating the old image 
we can not say that the dataset generated is of best quality but it is batter than repeating the same image to increase the size of a  dataset 

It’s no use having a lot of data if it’s bad data; quality matters, too. 

Consider taking an empirical approach and picking the option that produces the best outcome. With that mindset, a quality data set is one that lets you succeed with the business problem you care about. In other words, the data is good if it accomplishes its intended task.

However, while collecting data, it's helpful to have a more concrete definition of quality. Certain aspects of quality tend to correspond to better-performing models:

reliability
feature representation
minimizing skew
